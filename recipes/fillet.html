        <h2>Roast fillet of beef with roasted garlic and mustard cream</h2>

        <p>A tender cut of beef is a little bit of luxury and this is the perfect main course to cook for a gathering of friends.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1kg/2.2lb middle-cut thick fillet of beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 whole heads garlic</li>
            <li>150ml/¼ pint mayonnaise</li>
            <li>150ml/¼ pint full fat crème fraîche</li>
            <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (fan 200C).</li>
            <li>Rub the fillet of beef with plenty of salt and pepper and the oil.</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan until very hot. Fry the fillet on all sides until browned. Transfer to a roasting tin.</li>
            <li>Place the fillet in the centre of the roasting tin, arrange the whole garlic bulbs around the fillet and drizzle with a little oil. Roast for 23 minutes for medium-rare (only 20 minutes if it is a long, thin piece).</li>
            <li>When the beef is cooked, remove from the oven, cover with aluminium foil and leave to rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot or you can leave it to cool, and then wrap in more foil and place in the fridge to cool completely.</li>
            <li>To make the sauce, cut the roasted garlic bulbs in half horizontally and squeeze the garlic paste from each single clove into a bowl. Add the mayonnaise, crème fraîche and sugar.</li>
            <li>Blend to a smooth purée using a blender or food processor. Stir in the wholegrain mustard. Chill until ready to serve alongside the beef.</li>
            <li>Carve the beef into thin slices just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
